# Odin-TicTacToe

In this project, I will be building a web based game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The lesson I finished between the last project and this one was on factory functions and how they can be better than constructors in a lot of situations including when you need to make a function private from a user. I will be doing my best to implement factory functions when creating objects in this project.
